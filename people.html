          <p>1. Social and its consequences have been a disaster for the people. They have greatly increased the interconnectedness and education&endash;level of those of us who live in "universities," but they have crippled communication practices, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, and have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Suburbs to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted sever damage on analog social networks. The continued development of Social will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater government disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased psychological suffering even in "universities."</p>
          <p>2. Social may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineering products and mere cogs in the Social machine. Furthermore, if Social survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming of modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.</p>
          <p>3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p>4. We therefore advocate a revolution against Social. This revolution may or may not make use of violence: it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can't predict any of that. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its objects will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.</p>
